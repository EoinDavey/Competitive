doc
marty

completely
out
of
the
question
you
must
not
leave
this
house
you
must
not
see

they
dont
meet
they
dont
fall
in
love
they
wont
get
married

marty
doc
she

word
again
heavy
why
are
things
so
heavy
in
the
future
is
there
a
problem
with
the
earths
gravitational
pull
marty
what
doc
the
only
way
were
gonna
get
those
two
to
successfully
meet
is
if
theyre
alone
together
so
youve
got
to
get
your
father
and
mother
to
interact
at
some
sort
of
social
marty
what
well
you
mean
like
a
date
doc

marty
what
kind
of
date
i
dont
know
what
do
kids
do
in
the

doc
well
theyre
your
parents
you
must
know
them
what
are
there
common
interests
what
do
they
like
to
do
together
marty
nothing
doc
look
theres
a
rhythmic
ceremonial
ritual
coming
up
marty
of
course
the
enchantment
under
the
sea
dance
theyre
supposed
to
go
to
this
thats
where
they
kiss
for
the
first
time
doc
alright
kid
you
stick
to
your
father
like
glue
and
make
sure
that

marty

we
out
fitted
the

with
this
big
pole
and
hook
which
runs
directly
into
the
flux
capacitor
at
the
calculated
moment
you
start
off
from
down
the
street
driving
toward
the
cable
execrating
to
eighty
eight
miles
per
hour
according
to
the
flyer
at
10
04
pm
lightning
will
strike
the
clocktower
sending

point
twenty
one
gigawatts
into
the
flux
capacitor

the
time
machine
loraine
hi

my
doc
uncle
brown
loraine
hi
marty
hello
loraine
marty
this
may

a
little
foreward
but
i
was
wondering

ask
me
to
the
enchantment
under
the
sea
dance
on
saturday
marty
uh
you
mean
nobodys
asked
you

no
not
yet
marty
what
about
george
loraine
george
mcfly
oh
hes
kinda
cute
and
all
but
well
i
think
a
man
should
be
strong
so
he
could
stand
up
for
himself
and
protect
the
woman
he
loves
dont
you
marty
yeah
george
i
still
dont
understand
how
am
i
supposed
to
go
to
the
dance
with
her
if
shes
already
going
to
the
dance
with
you
marty
cause
george
she
wants
to
go
to
the
dance
with
you
she
just
doesnt
know
it
yet
thats
why
we
got
to
show
her
that
you
george
mcfly
are
a
fighter
youre
somebody
whos
gonna
stand
up
for
yourself
someone
whos
gonna
protect
her
george
yeah

i
never
picked
a
fight

not
gonna
be
picking
a
fight
dad
dad

her
marty

right
around
9
00
shes
gonna
get
very
angry
with
me
george
why
is
she

with
you
marty

of
them
george

gonna
touch
her
on
her
marty
